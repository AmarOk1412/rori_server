# rori_server

![](https://travis-ci.org/AmarOk1412/rori_server.svg?branch=master)

This is the central point of _[RORI](https://github.com/AmarOk1412/rori/)_. This application get data from entry points, call modules to process this data and send data to endpoints to execute commands. To understand how it works, you can read the [wiki](https://github.com/AmarOk1412/rori/wiki).

# Installation

This application requires _Rust language_ (please read this [page](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)) and _openssl_. To build the software, you just have to launch `cargo build` in this repository. You will need _Python 3_ to run modules. By the way, you will need dependencies for the modules you want to execute.

# Configuration

## From rori_www

This is not implemented yet, but you can try to connect [rori_www](https://github.com/AmarOk1412/RORI_www).

## From config_server.json

You can configure your server and the API from _config_server.json_:

```
"ip":"0.0.0.0",
"port":"1412",
"api_ip":"0.0.0.0",
"api_port":"3000",
```

## Connect entry and endpoints

Please read the [wiki](https://github.com/AmarOk1412/rori/wiki) or the [README of rori_desktop_client](https://github.com/AmarOk1412/rori_desktop_endpoint) for example.

## Tls configuration

All connections need to be secured. So you need to generate a private key and a certificate. On linux, you can run this following command: `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem`. It will create a certificate (_cert.pem_) and a private key (_key.pem_). Now, you can add these files to _config_server.json_.

## Final

Now, you _config_server.json_ looks like this:

```json
{
 "ip":"0.0.0.0",
 "port":"1412",
 "api_ip":"127.0.0.1",
 "api_port":"3000",
 "cert":"key/cert.pem",
 "key":"key/key.pem",
 "secret":"secret",
 "authorize": [
   {
     "name":"entry",
     "secret":"2BB80D537B1DA3E38BD30361AA855686BDE0EACD7162FEF6A25FE97BF527A25B"
   },
   {
     "name":"endpoint",
     "secret":"2BB80D537B1DA3E38BD30361AA855686BDE0EACD7162FEF6A25FE97BF527A25B"
   }
 ]
}
```

# Understanding the code

To understand the code, I will describe the process of a _RORIData_ through this application. A _RORIData_ is received by `core::Server::handle_client`. This function will make the distinction between a _RORIData_ for the server or for an endpoint. For example, if the datatype is _register_, it's a _RORIData_ for the server. This data is processed by the `ENDPOINTMANAGER` which manage endpoints. In the second case, the data is processed by a `ModuleManager` which calls modules for this datatype. To understand how modules works, you can read this [page](https://github.com/AmarOk1412/RORI/wiki/Write-modules). Then, when a module want to send data to a particular endpoint, it can use the API to get endpoint and send data. The code of these API is in `core::mod.rs` (TODO, the class will move in `core::API`).

# Execution

A binary is present in the _target/_ directory after a `cargo build` or you can execute `cargo run` in your shell.
